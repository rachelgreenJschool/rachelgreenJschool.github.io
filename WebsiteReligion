                    Arnold Porter raised his hands, looked up to the sky and joined in song with other church members around him. ‚ÄúThe Lord called me here to this congregation in 2013. I love it here and I like that I can come here or be a part of it at home,‚Äù he said.

Thanks to the use of technology, churches like World Changers International are able to enter the hearts and homes of thousands of people across the world. 
<br>
<br/>
The number of people at World Changers International Church in the Bronx has gotten smaller over the years, however, the congregation isn‚Äôt shrinking. The use of technology has allowed the church to expand and allowed more members to join the church. Members of all ages have joined services from the comfort of their homes as televangelism takes on new forms.

                  Creflo Dollar founded this non-denominational church in College Park, Georgia in 1986. The church held services in a cafeteria. The church relocated to a chapel, and later added a weekly radio broadcast. By 1995, World Changers moved to Atlanta which can hold 8,500 church members. Radio broadcast allowed him to reach a much larger audience. New church members gave money to expand to this new location and continue expansion.
<br>
<br/>
In 1990, Creflo Dollar started a television program with invited guests. This show was broadcast on more than 100 stations throughout the United States and continues today. 
<br>
<br/>
The church has not limited itself to one physical location. After the invention of the internet, the church began expanding to more than 30 locations across the world. Each congregation now holds services with live singers and musical accompaniment. Each service is recorded by television cameras and the congregations connect via live streaming to watch the pastor speak from Atlanta, Georgia or other locations.

                        Member Arnold Porter has visited various congregations over the last few years. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been to Atlanta for our annual church conference, I went to DC, and I watch at home too.‚Äù
<br>
<br/>
Members interviewed at the Bronx location are pleased to have the options to attend church at a physical location but say that there are fewer that are coming to church because they watch the stream from home. 
<br>
<br/>
The church is not only using technology such as projectors, screens and live streaming. Members can watch online from their homes on the website. The church has archived services there and on a YouTube channel as well.

                        Well over 30,000 attend the church. These members include those watching online and in church and is growing every year based on feedback given to them through their website, apps, and followers. 
<br>
<br/>
Members of the congregation are spread throughout the world. Dollar says, ‚ÄúWCCI has announced plans to open as many as 500 fellowship churches to accommodate for those who cannot attend the services on the main campus.‚Äù
<br>
<br/>
Members can also follow the church on Instagram. Every pastor has their own Instagram page. World Changers International has nearly 43,000 followers and Creflo Dollar currently has 433,000 followers.

                        Apps are also available for members to request prayers, read scriptures, check upcoming church events and give money to the church. A year ago, the church began a podcast, allowing listeners to access more of Dollar‚Äôs lessons.

Technology has created new opportunities for members to attend this particular church, access sermons, and connect with other members online.
